There are 3 kind of scale, take C as an example, we have: **Major (CM7)**, **neutral (C7)** and **minor (Cm7)**.

These following sequences denotes the offset (separated by a half-note) between notes that forms a certain scale:

```
**Major** : 0-4-3-4-1

**Neutral** :0-4-3-3-2

**Minor** : 0-3-4-3-2
```
