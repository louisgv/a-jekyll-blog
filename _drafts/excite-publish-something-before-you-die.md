It's been three months with jabSquared, things are getting tightened. The family has been growing a cultural where people could have fun while also manage to get things done. We just published `unifiesta` on the G marker. A is bouncing back some `c` trouble, hope they could cut us some slack.

Notoriously, the family are scaling at a very healthy, pleasant pace, where core developers have time to learn more skill, and relationship get the necessary time to develop, tightened and evolve.

My brothers have been learning. I am proud that they have picked up the habit of `curiosity`. Knowledgeable people are not afraid of knowledge. They want the `answers`, not an `answer`.

`Opinion` varies by perspectives due to relativity.

Thanks to the indexed web, learning through sheer research should have been obviously possible, if not because of those Academichoes who proposed a problem, while refuse to help fix it. The problem? The Internet is not a good source for knowledge. Or you peasant cannot read past the first result.



Thus, to best leverage way to learn from search, is to look for `three` options. The truth is not generalized. The truth is formalized. Each person themselves embrace their own truth.
