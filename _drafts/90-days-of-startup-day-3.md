Went to Impact hub, met [Swatee Surve](). Her company [Cambia Grove](), was [mentioned on the Seattle Times](https://bit.ly/1Wguvfm). She also organized the health track for @SEAStartupWeek.

We had a great q/a session surrounding the digital health care industry as well as [Sarah](), an Universal Health Record that I am working on. Brief outline before Frank, investor from friendly mentor, came by and join the conversation:

+ The problem that Sarah is trying to solve is not yet solidified. A suggestion would be
+ Geo-location is a deciding factor:
  + Be mindful about different area
+ Enterprise product will need to conform with many policy.
+ Go outreach with potential customer and investigate the model they conform to. Small clinic, big hospital, treatment center, or direct consumer?
  \---> **Suggestion:** Reach out to small clinic and interviewing nurses as they might contribute some valuable information.
+ Research the model that Sarah will go with, extensively.
+ For Direct Consumer (DC) product, two model:
  + One-shot iteration where user will likely to have a mindset of being "forced to use the product".
  + Beta upward iteration where user must have a mindset of "being a part of this project" and contribute for its growth.
+ DC in general will likely to experience low tolerance from end-user.

After Frank came by:

+ PIO
+ EHR battle is done

How about if  symptoms change?
How do we make sure the information we provide is nimble enough to serve the patient and the doctor throughout each screening process?
Patient could have gotten worse or better

Options for a must have relationship with clinicians
Get clinician
shadow  the patient's experience at the doctor's office.
How does the care get delivered
 Mapping out the process
Clinician workflow
What type of care setting within the health industry are you targeting?
Private patient healthcare

Hosting providers that comply with Hipaa/ How you're storing your data?
Aws
Azure
Other models that we need to study:
Healthkit
Allowing the user to confirm that their data will be transferred to other parties besides ourselves will mitigate some of the legal liabilities. How does Appleâ€™s HealthKit do it?
Webmd why have they not moved into this space
- Hipaa to us:
Protected Health Information (PHI)
Information About UNC Health Care
Financial and operational information  
Trade secrets of vendors and research sponsors  
System access passwords
We need to make sure user agrees to initially be open to sharing to x,y,z amount of people.
Disclosure for health only
If not do we have written authorization
If not is legal requirement for disclosure
Need to make sure data that is gathered with our app is useful to the doctor. Make sure the data is also compliant.

Usage for data collected about User
Users can choose to share their data with their families. People in her family could offer her data to their primary care physician when under the diagnostic process.

Value prop to the user?
How well are you going to take care of the patient?
Non-fragmented information on the patient. The physician can move through their diagnostic process without having to stop to find patients information.


How will our technology use the already well developed clinician to patient relationship   


Rich data sets comes from tech that is great at privacy
