Surely designers are not (yet) programmer, and they need not be. They could, however, definitely learn from their peer, especially the main programmer guy who code tons of back-end stuff. Entrance fee to this wealth of knowledge should not be that high... The world shpuld  be a place where knowledge is respected and shared without buoundery, except preparation sand some willingness to lear.
