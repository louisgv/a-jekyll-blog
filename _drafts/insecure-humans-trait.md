When we say it's a trait, it won't change, unless the gene of the next generation mutated into something that does not have consciousness of itself, without the sense of self-security, human might not have fight for themselves as hard as they could.

Come to Surveillance for a moment...

My boy Sanoy was sitting next to me the other day, told me that the mere fact that there is a camera somewhere looking at him makes him uneasy, and make him act not as he trully is.

The question is... What is thou true self? There is none.

The self is crafted on the fly. You never `control` your environment, and you will never be able to due to the sheer fact that nobody could control you. If you could control your environment, you would have to change someone. Changing someone makes enemies. Dealing with enemies require resources, and friends.

People who cannot live in a society should hang themselves and die.
