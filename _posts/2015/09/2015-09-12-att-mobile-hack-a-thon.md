Went for the pitch. I used Cita and integrated it into the theme of the event. First section of the pitch, I shared with everyone a story.

# Story

```
I have a brother, he loves to bike, and he had long hair. One day, as he was riding down the hill, he felt the need to scratch his head. As he tried to reach his finger through his helmet, a car suddenly came up, and almost crashed him. That night, my brother went home with a bald head.
```

After the story, people were made to acknowledge a small (specific) corner of the problem. In order to capture everyone's attention, I decided to expand and generalized the story into a "big picture" statement.

# Moral

```
The moral of the story is, if you ride a bike, you are adventurous. When you are adventurous, you love to have long hair. You have long hair, you feel itchy at the worst moment. And the moment you try to scratch it, accident happens.
```

Everyone got a good laugh as they realized how true the 2nd statement was. Now, the pitch should be easy as I have done them a "favor", i.e give them a smile. Now it should be my turn to "bother" them with my stupid idea, begin with another story:

# Origin

```
My team and I came up with this stupid idea last night with some friends. They just opened a barbershop near my house called the Beau barbershop. As I was having a hair cut, Tonio the owner of the place, said what if my brother back then got his hair cut before the accident?
```

The question acted as an intro entrance, now it should be easy to bring the product out:

# Introduction

```
Introducing Cita, an on-the-bike platform to schedule appointment with your favorite barbershop.
```

And thus the pitch continue with functionality, features, vision, and so on.

@those-who-were-there: Thank you for the laugh and the cheer.
