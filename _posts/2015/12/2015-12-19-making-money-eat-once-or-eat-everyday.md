# Story

Have you ever imagine being given the chance to eat only once in your life, then no more meal whatsoever, you have to live on, and die?

As biological being, we consume resource, and dispose waste. We do not stuff ourselves so that we will live on for the next week. Instead, we store the food, and eat it up for the next few months. Human have learned the ability to foresee and predict their food resources. And now, it's time to transit that ability to wealth and business.

You don't want to make money once. You want to make money everyday.

Making money by charging a lot of people within a long period is scalable. You can afford to lose money as well. If you can build the technology that back the tech, it is very easy to impress people and make money. There are a lot of people who are not technical. And you should help them. Say it, I want to help non-technical people!
