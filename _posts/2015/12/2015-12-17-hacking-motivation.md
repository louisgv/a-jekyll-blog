To hack is to go the way that works asap. Motivation depends on:
+ Simulation: what you gained
+ Reflection: what you learned
+ Situation: what you felt

Simulation are often shown in form of a reward. Reward could be nutrition, reputation, care, love, resources, money. Hence, people who have excessive reward aside what they what they get from their job often perform better than those who "depends" on their job's reward. Thus, try to find reward outside of your job that reinforce how you do your job, preferably from an outside source that relate to other people. Go help other in need and experience the thrill of doing so.

Reflection comes in term of learning and experience. If you learned that doing this benefits you, you are more likely to be motivated. So do the thing that you enjoy and you already hack your way through this learning process.

As for the situation, try to utilize what you have. But if you happen to live in a bad neighborhood, run. You need to run to environment where people who do what you do are accepted and are encouraged to thrive.
