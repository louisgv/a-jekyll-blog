# Do not waste time

+ Relationship takes time. Do not wait for it. Instead, works. Do not stare at the empty screen for a message of the future. The person you are waiting for is working. So should you.

+ If you cannot figure out what should you do, ask then plan:
  + Thus came to a point where you would plan ahead:
    + Where would you post your question?
      + List all the community forum available for the thing you are working on
      + List all the SUBREDDIT related
      + List all the Stackoverflow Tag related
      + List all the IRC channel and Slack group related
      + List all the Github issues page related
      + List all the Facebook, Twitter tag related
    + PUT ALL these resources in a planning board, like Trello. You will need it in the future.

+ Always working either toward goals or experience. Always look for low hanging fruit. Always look for thing that can make value asap.

+ Exploit your own product. Able to use a technology that can be crafted to something of value? Know some local guys who would happily paying $1/customer to try it out? DO IT! From local guy, go scout for other, local people, who cannot handle enterprise quote. Make money by having more customer, not by charging one customer alone!
