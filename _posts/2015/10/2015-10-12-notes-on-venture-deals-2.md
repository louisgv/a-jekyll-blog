+ $X for K% -> Valuation = X/K*100
+ Premoney and Postmoney
> VC: $5M at $20M -> 25%
> E: $5M at $20M (+$5M) = $25M -> 20%
>> E: I assume you mean $20M in valuation

```

# Focus on what you can Control

> Never take valuation personally. People are negotiating a deal to their advantage.

```
liquidation : $$$
IPO: Just another round of funding (JAROF)
```
Participation feature has a lot of impact at relatively low outcomes and less impact at higher outcomes.

# Pay-to-Play

> Avoid the scenario where VC has the right to force a recapitalization of the company if **fellow** investors bailed

Have an appropriate conversion to common for lack of follow-on investment

# Vexting

Time contract: investor must not bail within X Years to keep full share.

# Antidilution

> Wighted average Antidilution: If newer price is lower, earlier price is reduced to the new lower price.

> Ratchet-based Antidilution:

```
**NCP** : new conversion price
**OCP** : old conversion price
**CSO** : common stock outstanding
**CSP** : common stock purchasable
**CSAP**: common stock actually purchased
NCP = (CSO + CSP)/(CSO + CSAP) * OCP
```
