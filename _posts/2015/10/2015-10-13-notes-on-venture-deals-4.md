# Dividends

VCs who care about dividens either is a private equity guy or is focused on downside protection on larger deals

> Ensuring dividends have to be approved by a majority of BoD

# Redemption Rights

VCs focused on these for add-on downside protection. Redemption rights allow investor a guaranteed exit, for example, in a case of a company will become successfully enough to be an ongoing business but not enough for IPO or liquidize.

# Condition Precedent to Financing

> Avoid CPF as much as possible

Three conditions to watch out for:
1. Approval by Investors' Partnerships
2. Rights offering to be completed by company
3. Employment agreements signed by founders as acceptable to investors.

> A VC who won't spell out key employment terms at the beginning is a big red flag.

Remember: you don't necessarily have a deal just because you've signed a term sheet.

# Information Rights

> Run a transparent organization rather than spending time on this shit

# Registration Rights

> The world is good if you're going public.

# Right of First Refusal

Also know as pro rata right.
> Make sure shareholders get this right only if they play in subsequent rounds

# Voting Rights

Relationship between Preferred Stock and the Common Stock in the context of a share vote.

# Restriction of Sales

Also known as the right of first refusal on sales of common stock (ROFR on common).

# Founders' Activities

If founder are actually working on something else at the same time and don't disclose it, this term is violated.

# IPO Shares Purchase

Nice problem to have

# Indemnification

Basically insurance policy
