Crunching the book with @sanoy.

# Valuation talk

Went with @sanoy following Josh and Yasha. Pretty cool one, talking about the structure of stuffs involving financial and splitting the cash flow.

# Angel Pitch at Surf

Met with [Nathan DiNiro](https://www.linkedin.com/in/natediniro), talked about EHR and the three potential pivot for Sarah.
- EHR is dead
- He is working on a PHR/EHR system that utilize bitcoin's block chain mechanic to secure the data.
- [Edmund Butler](https://www.linkedin.com/in/edmundrbutler) joined the conversation. He also gave some insight about the industry.

Nathan said there has not been a PHR for woman that he know of. However, to tackle that, we need a woman co-founder.

+ Went back to Surf and hacked some React component.
