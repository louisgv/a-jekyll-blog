How to get more done? Human are designed to care about various of things. Even the greatest hacker wouldn't ignore some certain stuffs. Hackers ought to care about shit loads of stuffs, the change of the tech flow, everything.

Humans are 'greedy,' and the nature of the greedy algorithm is that so often, we won't care what lies beneath the tree. We take paths that seem reasonable 'now,' and we never care if it's the best route. Often, this reflects how startup these day are doing, and it might be the correct path. As the decision tree is endless, if it took a genius 3 years to come up with a direct route toward a route with the highest reward, a hacker might probably have went deep into the tree, possibly yielding not necessary good results, but an impressive amount of experience.

So for the experience, it is advised that startup people should definitely apply greedy algorithm, as reading the book won't help anyhow.

# Hack your Deadline

A common trend I observed when making decision is that people tends to give themselves a constraint of time working on things. For a feature, strive for 2 days. For a project, strive for 1 week. For a business, strive for 1 month. Keep in mind, always know that these are the virtual deadline that will blows up fast into real deadline. For in reality, a feature might take three weeks, a project 2 months, and a business 2 years. The pattern here is to add 1 and increase the time unit.

Using time to increase moral of the team is also crucial, given that you are good enough and can take the hacking load. Not many


# Hack your Free-time

Human need rest. As a hacker, even if you think you don't need rest, you do, so take it periodically. You don't want a malfunction brain. You want to increase productivity. You don't want an unhealthy body. You want to enjoy life after this. And you surely don't want a dry dick/virgina. You need a great sex life once your company got acquired. So, what should you do?

First, change yourself, your hobbies, your interest, such that it all align with your startup || goal. A software/game startup? Make you hobby working on tutorial/ learning more about dev tips and trick, or exeprience the role of the sale guy. A hardware startup? Make your hobby fixing stuffs, DIY, etc... Make yourself enjoy these activity, punish your soul into liking these hobby. You need it to make your first hundred thousand bucks.

The desire to doing unproductive but entertaining stuffs greatly surpass the amount of thought going toward goal, as the former is easy and the latter hard.

People want excuse to avoid hard things. This is a dangerous mindset in anyway, as it slow down learning, and distract the person from his own role.

In a lot of software startup, one thing that bug me is how people still keep their hobby running wild while still claiming to be working on a startup. The software people universal hobby is video game. And just to clarify, if you spend an hour playing game in exchange for 18 hours of productive work, that's ok. Don't do it the other way around.
