How to get more done? Human are designed to care about various of things. Even the greatest hacker wouldn't ignore some certain stuffs. Hackers ought to care about shit loads of stuffs, the change of the tech flow, everything.

Humans are 'greedy,' and the nature of the greedy algorithm is that so often, we won't care what lies beneath the tree. We take paths that seem reasonable 'now,' and we never care if it's the best route. Often, this reflects how startup these day are doing, and it might be the correct path. As the decision tree is endless, if it took a genius 3 years to come up with a direct route toward a route with the highest reward, a hacker might probably have went deep into the tree, possibly yielding not necessary good results, but an impressive amount of experience.

So for the experience, it is advised that startup people should definitely apply greedy algorithm, as reading the book won't help anyhow.
