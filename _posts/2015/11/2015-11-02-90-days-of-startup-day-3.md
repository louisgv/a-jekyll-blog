  Wednesday, third day of Startup Week, I went to the Impact Hub with @sanoy and met [Swatee Surve](https://www.linkedin.com/in/swatee). Her company [Cambia Grove](http://www.seattletimes.com/business/technology/new-local-hub-examines-health-care-innovation/), was [mentioned on the Seattle Times](https://bit.ly/1Wguvfm). She also organized the health track for @SEAStartupWeek. We had a great q/a session surrounding the digital health care industry as well as [Sarah](https://hisarah.meteor.com), a simple, friendly & natural personal health record that I was working on.

  After having listened to my pitch, Swattee gave me three suggestions. First, I should solidify the problem, Sarah seems too broad. I should narrow Sarah down to solve one definite problem. Second, I should investigate on how geo-location could influences Sarah's behavior. Third, I need to do more outreach with potential customer to investigate the model and work-flow that they conform to. Available models include small clinic, big hospital, treatment center, and direct consumer? She suggested that for Sarah's case, I should reach out to small clinic and interviewing nurses as they might contribute some valuable information.

  [Frank](https://www.linkedin.com/in/frankstartups) came by, and joined the conversation. We dove deeper into the good and the bad of each customer model. In health care, there are two customer model: `Enterprise` and `Direct Consumer`, each has its own set of pros and cons.

--------------------------------- | --------------------------------------
pros:                             |
- higher liability                | - no extra policies
- lower adoption cost             | - easier to reach
--------------------------------- | --------------------------------------
cons:                             |
- more extra policies             | - higher adoption cost
- harder to reach                 | - low tolerance

Both models has two deploy routes:
- One-shot iteration where user will likely to have a mindset of being "forced to use the product".
- Beta upward iteration where user must begin with a mindset of "being a part of this project" and contribute to its growth.

Swatee pointed out that the symptom reported by the user might not be useful and would often just disappear. The symptom might also changes depend on the environment.

On the policy problem, Swatee and Frank recommended us to look at available services that are already HIPAA compliant. AWS and Azure are two such PaaS. Data transfer as well as the consent to share the data must be re-enforced as well.

On the other hand, how can Sarah make-use of the available data out there?

Anyway, that was a fun conversation...
