Seattle Startup Week is happening.

Met Andy and Josh at the Hub, listening to Diversity talk.

Met Lee (@leepngo), pretty cool guy, working with Galvanize. Advised that before pitching to people, better ask what they do first before letting the humble/hustle chime in. As Lee is interested in education, he wouldn't be of use when talking about Sarah either.

Met with Leo. He was pretty cool as well, gave some insight on how to investigate customers.

Went to Coffee with Andy, leaving passed out @Sanoy at Galvanize. Lee will take care of him for sure. Met Frank there. Made some mistake last week (catching up and missed appoinment). He was cool however, saying "It's good that you guys take responsibility for mistakes." However due to chatting with Frank, Andy just went on and paid for the coffee and snacks. (Sorry Andy, next time it's on me).

Went back to Galvanize for a mentor talk about inclusion and expansion of the startup area in Seattle. Met David. He was pretty cool.

Panel includes David, Rebecca, Frank and Ruby.

Stayed and talk with David and Frank. David brought up the issue of how maker space doesn't have the look and feel of an apple store. Frank loves the idea, and told David to link up soon on the idea.

David is passionate about starting a diversified maker space. Sounds cool!

I have decided to officially kick off my startup company. We are working on a digital health care project codenamed `Sarah`. The idea was coined internally with @sanoy two weeks ago. After a brief interview last Friday with three individuals (including a colonial cancer doctor), I decided to revamp the idea to be a more focused and more viable one:

```
  Sarah is an AI that collects your Personal Health Record (PHR) through a friendly conversation.
```

Digital PHR is nothing new. According to Wikipedia, the oldest record of PHR was from 1902. However, most white paper on the subject are dated after 2000. Thus, the curve jumping is happening for the medical health-care industry. Medical data is being transfered from the hospital to the patients' pocket device.

Direct consumer solution model allows for a flexible iteration work-flow. In this model, the MVP improve as we gather more user feedback at early stage. The only catch is that future adoption cost will be relatively high. But I think we need more experimentation.

Coincidentally, three weeks ago a digital health record startup failed. The founder of that startup generously wrote a blog on why he decided to kill his startup. It was a trail blazer for me. Alongside this entrepreneur's vision of the product, I also got some useful information on who should I watch out for, namely the three startup that are working day and night for a piece of the digital PHR pie:
- []()
- []()
- []()

The pain point within the health industry today is still record transaction. Lots of patients still have their data on paper file, and sending/receiving piles of these wood fiber took days. They are unnecessary, redundant technology that are killing people.

During the health industry conference (Startup Week), there was another pain point shared by an entrepreneur: Hospital do not want to share patient data, as they afraid they might lose the patient.

However, a closer inspection of this idea revealed some uncertainty:
- What if doctor still keep data they collected afterward for themselves?
- What if Sarah's way of collecting data just does not work?
- What if the curve jumping needed more time and that these idea are somewhat still too early?
