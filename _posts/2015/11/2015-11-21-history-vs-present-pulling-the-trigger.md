One recent discussion on a bus with @sanoy brought up an interesting question:

Given a man (call him A) who is pointing a gun at another man (call this guy B). A wants to kill B because :
  + A was ordered to kill
  + A wants something from B
  + A don't like B

For any of those reason, if suddenly the life of B flash in front of A (the cliche that many media depict one would experience the moment they die), will A pull the trigger if B was indeed:
  + Someone totally innocent
  + Someone who don't have or have but not worth killing
  + Someone very likable but on a wrong drunk mood

This question could be simulated with video games. For example, we have you as person A, pointing a gun at person B and suddenly you learn everything about B. At the end, you choose to either pull or release the trigger. If the answer was indeed A will not pull the trigger if he could learn that B is a good guy (in A's perspective), then this brought up to two interesting conversation: "Your data could save your life," and "human relates with each other's pass".

Imagine now you are guy B in real life. If guy A could witness all of your happy moment with your child, your family, your friend, there is a chance he would not pull the trigger. Thus, keeping your profile update and be able to show it to this guy A might be something interesting in the future. Maybe Facebook might save your ass one day, who know?
