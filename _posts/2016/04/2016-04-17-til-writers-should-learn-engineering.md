A lot of writer have a naive bias view of their own universe. Every single piece of writing has a certain bias way to describe the world view of the writer as well as his sense toward either positive or negative.

In the real world, there are always 3 force pulling outward that kept the balance of sense and justice in place: positive, negative, and neutral.

However due to lack of paper, screen-time, or budget, writers these day can only afford to rush and express one of the force. Either negative, neutral, or positive. After all, people just want them to get straight to the point.

Then what the hell is with Liberal Art anyway?
