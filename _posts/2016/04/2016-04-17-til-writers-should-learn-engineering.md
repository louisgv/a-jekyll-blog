A lot of writer have a naive bias view of their own universe. Every single piece of writing has a certain bias way to describe the world view of the writer as well as his sense toward either positive or negative.

In the real world, there are always 3 force pulling outward that kept the balance of sense and justice in place: positive, negative, and neutral.

However due to lack of paper, screen-time, or budget, writers these day can only afford to rush and express one of the force. Either negative, neutral, or positive. After all, people just want them to get straight to the point.

Then what the hell is with Liberal Art anyway?

On the other hand, some were on the verge of being great content with 2 forces. However they always miss either the positive, or negative side of the problem.

For example, Black Mirror has an episode where the human mind can be copied and simulated into a virtual world. The concept was great and spot on.

Note that the human mind is `copied`, not `transfered`. Thus in the virtual simulated world, the copy of the person's mind was created, and often put to work or to be exploited. Much like a world of Inception where nobody know if they are dreaming or not, in this universe people have a sense they don't know if things are real or it's just their somewhere.
