A lot of writer have a naive bias view of their own universe. Every single piece of writing has a certain bias way to describe the world view of the writer as well as his sense toward either positive or negative.

In the real world, there are always 3 force pulling outward that kept the balance of sense and justice in place: positive, negative, and neutral.

However due to lack of paper, screen-time, or budget, writers these day can only afford to rush and express one of the force. Either negative, neutral, or positive. After all, people just want them to get straight to the point.

Then what the hell is with Liberal Art anyway?

On the other hand, some were on the verge of being great content with 2 forces. However they always miss either the positive, or negative side of the problem.

For example, Black Mirror has an episode where the human mind can be copied and simulated into a virtual world. The concept was great and spot on.

Note that the human mind is `copied`, not `transfered`. Thus in the virtual simulated world, the copy of the person's mind was created, and often put to work or to be exploited. Much like a world of Inception where nobody know if they are dreaming or not, in this universe people have a sense they don't know if things are real or it's just their somewhere.

This episode however demonstrates only the dark side of the issues. Writers dramatize and focus on how the human exploit their virtual copy, even give the copy tons of wasted electricity to "torture" them. Seriously?

Now the one that I'm most disagree with happen to be the scene where a woman decided to copy her mind into an egg-shell like home management device (it's as small as an egg, with a blue LED hole on top). Now the copy doesn't like it one bit. Yes, the copy of the mind also bring in `emotion` and so on. And then we see the treatment put on these copy. They were not treated like human, but merely tools, slave, whatever negative role the writer want you to think about.
