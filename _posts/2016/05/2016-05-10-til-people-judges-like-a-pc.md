True or false
Wrong or right

We judge like a PC.

Good or bad
High or Low

We think like a PC.

One or zero
Ugly or beautiful

We still judge like a PC

Hor or cold
Near or far

We might as well be a PC

Imagine a world where people actually think like a super computer
The thing so many brain thought they are

You would judge like a QM

True and false
Wrong and Right

You think like a QM

Good and Bad
High and Low

You act like a QM

One and Zero
Ugly and beautiful

You look like a QM

Hot and Cold
Near and Far

You cannot be a QM

To be a QM, is to be in a virtual world
A world where space and time allows complex shit to happen.
Complex shit that is not you.
So be glad that you think like a PC.
