A blog detailing thoughts and process taken to test and experiment all of the C suit role. Mainly the two CEO and CTO. And how misleading the title actually sounds in a real profitable business that is not a bozo.

# Plan

+ Living the life of either role, log down what's happening on a note.
+ Each month spend a day to reflect on what happened.
+ Give it some thought.

# Execution / Exp

+ Notes unorganized
+ Worked too much that the thought of starting this blog was forgotten
+ Also it's not fun donning the C suit without the salary or the instant reward of doing so. However the chance to work and do cool stuff is immensely cool, but not as rewarding.
+ The more you work, the more you treasure your craft.
