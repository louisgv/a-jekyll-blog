# Statement

  We are living in a world where private means security.

# Example

  + Trade secrets
  + Money in the bank
  + Family lineage

# Problem

  + Just like in the DNA, unless mutated, the Chromosome will end up cutting its core in half, then die. A private closed system eventually equates to inner resource consumption. Once resource are gone, this system will seize to exist.

If public equates security, one thing eliminated from the equation is stress. However, to a lot of people at the moment, `stress` plays a huge role on boosting progress, an artifact of having a dominant closed system.

Thanks to the open source movement, free stuffs are giving people new perspective. There are now more people enjoying the freedom of `doing something useful`.

Until security is of a higher level...

Since the concept of security are being shared between classes of people, we have yet to avoid the private club...
