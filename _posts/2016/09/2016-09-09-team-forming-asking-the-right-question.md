Forming team as if your life depended on it.

Recently for example, I got in a group project and I made a mistake that I have made so many time prior but never write about it. However a mistake perceived is still a mistake. And that was not asking the right question. I was too easy going in accepting teammate due to their friendly opening, that I completely forgot to be critical about their goal. Them liking the idea is one thing, but being in the same chemical mindset as myself, is a completely different story, and one that is crucial to the success of this idea, if they ever really like it.

Scouting a hustler is just as hard as looking for a good tree inside a forest. They are all wood, but only 1% make the best furniture.

And thus, a method to fish these rare creature need to be derived, as for one human is complicated but also are vulnerable on the first face to face. And secondly, we
