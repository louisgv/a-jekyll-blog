Ever feels helplessness when a movie character got lay off just like you 3 hours ago? Or the feeling of the main heroin sharing her first kiss with a man who was not the main character - an embodiment of the viewer, or you yourself? The feeling of satisfaction maybe, when a character does exactly what you wanted?

All of these feeling was created, part by your desire, part by the culture traps that you are all living in.

Human desires creates emotional expectation, and it makes human crave for result. Just like horse racing, every bet were made with a notion of earning unfair advantage in incomes, despite the fact that unless an insider decided to share with you the horse status, there is no logic behind the scene, they simply just bet. Movie director often exploit this human behavior to create what's called the emotional disturbance. By making the opposite of what a normal person expect, they were able to attract 81% attention from those `normal` group of people. The rest of course, can go fuck themselves.

Culture trap. This trap luckily, are engraved on certain regions, it is a location based phenomenon. You can try to escape it by flying to different continent. Usually 180 miles can get you out of your current trap. However, your mind might never get out of it. Adaptation is still experimental, as culture conflict is a huge burden to the mind. Also, these trap spreads through the media, so often, escape might be futile, as your mind might already be engraved into believing in such culture.

Observed, there are two reactions to these traps: succumb to it and be sway by its very present laws, or trying to oppose it, with still a notion of recognition that it is there, and that whatever you do, you can only walk around it.

Finding the trap that you would be comfortable resides in is the good thought, as every place in life, there need a trap to control the general thought. Else, human would lose one of their distinctive ability: communication.

So next time you saw a heroin exchanging her first kiss with someone other than the protagonist, always look for the underlying lesson, so you can prevent your future from suffering the same, and be the one to get that kiss, protagonist!

Anyhow, this rant is dedicated to the folk who made Noragami... That show was good, with all the animation and nu-folk music (Inspired by god eater?). Although, fuck that going to the Disney land scene, it really was like a distraction. Without that scene I would still consider the show to be pretty good! And what the fuck? If you really thinking about it, she was mouth raped! She was kissed against her fucking will duh! Who give you permission to kiss a girl when she's crying for memory? Fuck!

Also, fuck Air Gear, Uzumaki, eh... and any plots where not only the heroin wasn't give enough attention too, but was also depicted only with their beauty, and in the end was exploited to make readers feel emotional. That's like licking the bottom of reader's asshole!

Really, fuck all you twisted mangaka fucks! Though... great artwork, I loves how you guys draw those curve, and the details, and those particle animation!

FUCK
