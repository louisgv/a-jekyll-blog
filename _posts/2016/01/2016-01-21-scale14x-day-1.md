# 10:00:00 AM

Ubuntu intro talk. Almost a sale pitch on the latest dev tool available on the Ubuntu platform.

# 1:00:00 PM

Went for lunch at a Chinese restaurant. Got some Smoked Asian Salmon. Was good. Met two gentlemen, one were in charge of community management of the Yocto Project, and worked remotely with Intel. The other was a member of the Linux Foundation, working on his own consulting firm. We had a conversation about swagg, including shock and underwear. Yocto == small, thus if Yocto had underwear swagg, it should be small.

Then talking about available conference, mainly embedded device conference as they were giving Alan advices. Mentioned are:

  + ELCE   :
  + ELC    :
  + DLCE   : Many big name person will be here

Building apps with Snappy
Pretty obfuscated talk. Mostly a demo of how to approach the docs. Keywords are:

  + [LxD](http://www.ubuntu.com/cloud/lxd)
  + Snap Craft
  + [Snap Craft Parts (Not the MineCraft server)](https://developer.ubuntu.com/en/snappy/build-apps/snapcraft-parts/)
  + [Ubuntu Make](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-make)

Juju? (Slide he broke all th rules about speaking)

+ Basically a service deployer/Platform configurator, very similar to CloudFoundry.

  + AWS credit for Juju instance test: http://developer.juju.solutions/
  + Summit link: http://summit.juju.solutions/

+ Hook vs Reactive in Juju
+ How do you guarantee the order of execution?
  + > Cannot guarantee order of execution at installation
  + > Not when the hook run is not controllable
  + > Solution : Setting responding state instead of responding to hook
    + The better state represent the server, the more control.
