# 10:00:00 AM

Ubuntu intro talk. Almost a sale pitch on the latest dev tool available on the Ubuntu platform.

# 1:00:00 PM

Went for lunch at a Chinese restaurant. Got some Smoked Asian Salmon. Was good. Met two gentlemen, one were in charge of community management of the Yocto Project, and worked remotely with Intel. The other was a member of the Linux Foundation, working on his own consulting firm. We had a conversation about swagg, including shock and underwear. Yocto == small, thus if Yocto had underwear swagg, it should be small.

Then talking about available conference, mainly embedded device conference as they were giving Alan advices. Mentioned are:

  + ELCE   :
  + ELC    :
  + DLCE   : Many big name person will be here
