Three person on the bus look down at an ant. Their perspective differ. So from the narrative, it is an ant. but from the 1st person, it is a dog. From the 2nd person, it is an elephant. From the 3rd person, it is another person.

Five person discussing the same concept and sharing knowledge. Suddenly one guy would like to change the concept into a dog. His was a black dog. The other's color are of different color. However, trivial question were not asked. The five person discuss how they can tame the dog in their mind.
