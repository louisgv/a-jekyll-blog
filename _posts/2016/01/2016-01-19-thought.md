# Gyros

Went to Eugene. Had a lamb plate by Greek chefs. It was good, grilled medium-rare lamb, very tender and juicy. Salad was great with olive and all the Greek blended herb, no ranch needed. However there were only 6 cubes of lamb meat...

Back to downtown Seattle. Had a gyro plate, made by a South Asian (Palestine or Iraq?) chef. Lots of meat, but those diced frozen meat were very bland, full of MSG to hide how many day it was stored. Salad was a joke: sliced cabbage and diced onion? The paste of ranch just made the joke funnier. The pita bread was over-seasoned as well.

Caught the bus to Bellevue. Had a gyro chicken plate. This time, by an Indian chef. It was a curry. Sauce was so-so, the scent of spice and herb were there but the MSG screwed their taste. Long grain rice, cooked with chai tea, were dry and the scent of chai was very bland. The chicken were frozen, so the meat was not as tender, and easily broken apart. Salad was yet another joke.

Advice to have some good gyro: Ask if they grill your meat, else run. Or, be a vegetarian.
