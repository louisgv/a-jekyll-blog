Expressing Gratefulness is one of the most challenging. For most people, a thank you is fine, but often it devalue the favor. For the entrepreneur however, they often think of action. How can they repay the favor by action, by some form of gratitude that is not just a thank you. They want to say thank you by the end of their pay back.

Sometime doing a good deed is fine... But people thought of un-friendly things while expect other to give them back.
