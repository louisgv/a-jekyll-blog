# Preparation
Fly down to LaX. Got some food at the Miyo Teriyaki place.

> Advise: Never get the sushi. They said it's `special`, it is not. Frozen, lots of rice, and just a fucked up experience.

# Plane
Met a woman. She shared a story of a drunkard friend who lived where I live. His liver was destroyed, and the guy is now living inside a hospital. Her ticket to get up there was bought by the guy's family member.

Swapped seatbelt with an old man sitting on the left. He was working on a financial partner firm. He was drafting his business deliverable and the company's logo.

# Hotel
Setup the TV to stream youtube content. Had some fun stuff about wholefood's overpriced items and sex education.
