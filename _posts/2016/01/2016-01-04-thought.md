# Spanish Grammar

When it comes to self, `yo` goes with verbs end with `o`. For example `yo bebo`, `yo hablo`, `yo como`... What is the reason for this grammar structure? Was it because the `o` sound at the end of `yo` that makes the original Spanish speaker thought of such derivation? For the other person `tu` goes with verb that ends with `s`, for example `tu comes`, `tu bebes`. On the other hand, `el` and `ella` go with verbs that does not have `s`. For example, `el bebe`, `ella habla`, `el lee`.
