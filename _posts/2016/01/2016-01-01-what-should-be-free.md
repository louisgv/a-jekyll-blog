# Nutrition

How to make nutrition available freely to everyone on Earth?... Civilization are so used to the concept of trading good that it's not even funny anymore...

# Internet

Instead of striving for a world where basic nutrition is free, the world is all over free Internet... We accept to die knowing. Is this movement toward information (and knowledge...?) necessary and realistically?

If everyone could take charge and setup a raspberry pie server that broadcast their Internet for other for free, we might have free WiFi sooner than waiting for those packages from big companies.

# Gym

We need more community driven gym space... Too many subscription gym place that doesn't make sense when it comes to the low income people...

# Transportation

Certified Car-Pool app would be great... But Uber came and now everyone want you to pay up.

# Medication

Free treatment for rare disease is not what doctor want...
