Art is relative. To make it easy to understand for those who think humans are the same, dog loves art too, but a different kind of art. Thought I do think a lot of bionic creature on Earth could appreciate the art of nature, not quite many came to enjoy another form of art. Human have developed a taste of art which originate from themselves.

Imagine if dogs were as evolved, connected and stabilized like human, I think they would develop a form of art for themselves too. Since after they have got their basic need such as food, they would need entertainment. On the other hand, I doubt if a cat would do so, they are lazy...

Now to the point, since Art is relative, exploit this fact to create art that is understandable to your target audience. Do not make art to enjoy yourself. Do so during your leisure time, do have fun with it. But when your job is to make a piece of art, make it such that it is understood by your viewers.

The same for any profession I dare say. A programmer should make as many automated script for herself as she wish, but the moment she entered an environment to make value with other people, she should at least indent and comment those clever code. A cook should enjoy cooking for himself, and a writer should know to write for herself and have fun. But when it turn to business, be professional.

Hacking art comes from the point of view of doing what people want, and that's it. How do you know if people want it or not? Ask for feedback early on. Too many media taught us how we should charge our ki before releasing it, but in most case, do not do so. Charging your ki will only make it worst. Letting people know about what you are doing and communicate and show it to them such that they have the same vision as you is crucial to get the job done.

Now when it comes to hacking the niche art, making what these people want are now way harder. Imagine JRPG players vs FPS players, and you will see the diff in genre. It also depends on where you live, so if you live in a place where people enjoy FPS, better make FPS. If people around you enjoy JRPG, it might be more encouraging to make those game. Thus, make your art based on your geolocation.
