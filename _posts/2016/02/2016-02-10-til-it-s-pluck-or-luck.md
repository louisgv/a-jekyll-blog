# The lucky traveler problem

Given a set of destination (d), traveling cost (c), opportunity point (o), and a percentage which indicate the chance of getting that opportunity (p), find the best route to gain the most opportunity while minimizing the traveling cost.

And something else

# Solving the Rubik Cube

Try your best solving the first face. Then, to solvce the middle layer, there is a trick:

+ Align the color you want to switch from the top. Then switch it to the side, put the corner up, and input the new information into the block while also saving the information of the previous color. Then, swing the middle cube to save the information of the new lines, then bring back the saved information of the outer line back, pull them down. Then Re-align the whole thing, this time you will see the middle cube was missing, but just pull the middle guy down and insert it back. Information traveling in the Rubik cube is an interesting pattern. You will need to try to both saving information and writing new information at the same time...
