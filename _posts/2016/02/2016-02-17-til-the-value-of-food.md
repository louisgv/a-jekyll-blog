The price of food is being kept at an enormous high price due to the lack of cooperation between people. The cost of food does not equal its value in anyway, be it nutrition, amount, or even the calories offered. The food industry is the most corrupted industry in the world because it is better to let 90% of people starve to the point of wanting to work, or die.

This industry relies on an unfair advantage that is simply non-human supportive.

To be an industry, there must be imbalance. If the imbalance is gone, so does the industry as the need to exchange value is gone. The value dilutes into a state of flow in which everyone receives the value as common wealth.

The food industry has kept its market to span across every single person on earth. The danger of such imbalance is that it contributes to all the other imbalances that are present, thus created a huge gap in wealth, education, and health.

A whole chicken obviously offer more protein than a bowl of soup. The chicken also will have more value in term of protein and amount of bite compared to kale. But the price of a roasted chicken is $8, a bowl of soup is $6, and the kale is $3.

When a person look at this price, they will definitely take the chicken. They would not go for the Kale purely because the price does not seem right. The amount of bite and the amount of protein they would get from the soup and the kale does not add up when compared to the chicken.

People are fucked
